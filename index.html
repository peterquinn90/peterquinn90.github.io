        <p>It was at this time, I decided to start programming. I decided to take the JavaScript course on Kahn Academy, as it was the first class I saw. Since then, I have taken the HTML and CSS courses.

        Some people may even be tempted to abandon coding altogether, as the oh noes' guy may get in their head. <br>
        <br>
        Here is some more stuff about abandoning programming. There is hope though! You should consider additional courses. <br>
        <br>
        Here's one more paragraph about the additional courses.
